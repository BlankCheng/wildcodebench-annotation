    """
    Obtain system details, including operating system, architecture, and memory usage.
    
    This function gathers information about the system's operating system, architecture,
    and memory usage. It calculates the percentage of used memory  by comparing the total
    and currently used memory. The gathered details are then returned in a dictionary 
    format with specific keys for each piece of information.
    
    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing:
            - 'OS': Operating System name (e.g., 'Windows', 'Linux').
            - 'Architecture': System architecture (typically first item from platform.architecture(), e.g., '64bit').
            - 'Memory Usage': Formatted string representing the percentage of memory currently in use, 
                              calculated as (used memory / total memory) * 100.
  
    Requirements:
        - platform
        - psutil

    Examples:
        >>> system_info = f_1020()
        >>> isinstance(system_info, dict)
        True
        >>> 'OS' in system_info
        True
        >>> 'Architecture' in system_info
        True
        >>> 'Memory Usage' in system_info
        True
