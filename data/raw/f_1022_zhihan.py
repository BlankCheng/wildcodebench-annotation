def f_1022(l1, l2):
    """
    Alternates elements from two numeric lists, calculates the absolute difference of each 
    element from a predefined threshold, and returns the element closest to this threshold.
    
    Parameters:
    l1 (list): The first input list containing numeric values.
    l2 (list): The second input list containing numeric values.
    
    Returns:
    float: The element from the combined list that is closest to the threshold of 0.5.
    
    Requirements:
    - numpy
    - itertools.zip_longest

    Notes:
    - If l1 and l2 are of different lengths, elements from the longer list without a corresponding 
      pair in the shorter list will not be paired with 'None'. Only existing numeric elements are considered.
    - The threshold is fixed at 0.5. Adjustments to the threshold require changes to the THRESHOLD constant.
    
    Example:
    >>> l1 = [0.3, 1, 2, 3]
    >>> l2 = [0.7, 11, 12, 13]
    >>> closest = f_1022(l1, l2)
    >>> print(closest)
    0.7
